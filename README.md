  - `Item_Fat_Content`: Whether the product is "Low Fat" or "Regular".
  - `Item_Visibility`: How prominently the product is displayed in the store.
  - `Item_Type`: The category of the product (e.g., Dairy, Soft Drinks, Meat).

## Purpose of Analysis
This project aims to:
- Identify **best-selling products** to improve stock management.
- Analyze how **store size and location** impact sales.
- Understand how **pricing and visibility** affect sales performance.
- Predict **future sales trends** to optimize business strategies.

## Key Insights from Data Exploration
1. **Sales Distribution:** Sales data is right-skewed, meaning most products have lower sales, but a few items sell exceptionally well.
2. **Price Impact:** Higher-priced items tend to have higher sales, suggesting pricing plays a crucial role.
3. **Store Size Influence:** Medium-sized stores seem to have higher sales than small or large stores.
4. **Visibility & Sales:** Items with very low visibility still generate sales, indicating brand loyalty or necessity-based purchases.

This analysis helps businesses **make informed decisions** about product placement, pricing, and store expansion strategies.
